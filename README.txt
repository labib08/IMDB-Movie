#How to run the models:

All the models are in one file main.py where the main function contains the function for the four models

Make sure to have all the libraries (mentioned at the top of main.py) installed on the local machine.

Keep the training and test dataset in the same directory as the main.py file, as well as the features_doc2vec folder that was already given

Hit run and all the results of each model will be displayed
